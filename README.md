# Awesome-Portfolio

This is my current portfolio page.
In this project I've used Express, Bootstrap, and Handlebars primarily. 

The bubbles used for the background were one of the hardest parts to get together for this page as it was my first time doing something like this. I learned about "webkit", "moz", and "o" keyframes, very interesting seeing how different browsers render things slightly differently. I also learned about the css property "overflow", since the bubbles shifting to off the side of the page created a scroll bar as long as they were there. 

I also learned about incoroporating custom fonts on the server as "woff" files, and how to apply them.

Included are links to my linked-in and github as well as a link to serve my resume as a PDF.
