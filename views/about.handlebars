            <h4><strong>Hi, I'm Branden! A Web Dev from South West Florida!</strong></h4>
            <h5><strong>Sequelize, Express, Handlebars, Nodejs, my SEHN-Stack game is strong.</strong></h3>
                <p>As a dedicated learner, I will pour countless hours into a project until I understand it
                    inside
                    and
                    out. My parent's said to me when growing up, "Never stop learning!" </p>
                <p>The majority of my work experience has been in the service industry. Web development seemed
                    like
                    an
                    amazing oppourtunity to escape, and I am enthusiastic to continue growing in this field. So
                    far,
                    I'm
                    only a fledgling, but if I keep working hard at a problem, I know my work will shine like
                    none-other.</p>
                <p>I am excited to show my passion for coding, and will continue growing as long as I pursue it.
                    As long the goal is in mind, target focus will ensure success. Remembering the
                    'Why' for doing things.
